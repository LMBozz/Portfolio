        My name is Luke. I am a student and aspiring developer.
        I have been involved with computing and technology my entire life,
        and have wanted to be a programmer for as long as I can remember.
        Growing up with video games and computers, I spent a lot of my time
        taking them apart and putting them back together countless times, and doing
        so developed a skill and love for messing with technology.
        <br><br>
        I have a deep passion for anything computing, and simply
        wish to spend the rest of my life with a career doing what
        I both love and am good at.
        <br><br>
        In addition to programming, I have a deep-set interest in
        Cryptography and Steganography. I regularly compete in CTF's
        and online competitions, solving puzzles and breaking
        encryptions. I'm also involved with many code golf and
        competitive coding and problem solving communities online,
        being ranked within the top 600 in the world on CodinGame.com
        for Clash of Code!
